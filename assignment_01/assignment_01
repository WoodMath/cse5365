Purpose: Feb. 17, 2016 11:59PM

    Practice in
        3-dimensional composite transforms.
        2-dimensional window to viewport mapping

 
Task:
Add a "Load" command (button) to Assignment_00 such that the program will be able to read
the data from an input file and display the data on the viewport.
Details: 

    Load (Open) Input File

 

    This command loads all the data and parameters from a text file. The system should
    prompt for the name of the input  file. Each  line of the file will contain either
    a vertex, a face, or a viewing parameter definition as described below:

v <x1> <y1> <z1>  //Define a vertex
v <x2> <y2> <z2>
.
.
.
v <xn> <yn> <zn>
f <k1> <l1> <m1> //Define a face (k, l , and m are integers corresponding to the vertex number)
f <k2> <l2> <m2>
.
.
.
f <km> <lm> <mm>
w <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>   // Define 2D Window
s <xmin><ymin><xmax> <ymax. //Define viewport (normalized coordinates)

    Notes:

    Each "v" line defines a new vertex with the given x,y,z coordinates.
    Each vertex is given a unique identifier starting from 1 (not 0).
    Each "f" line defines a new triangular face whose corners are the vertices with the given identifiers u,v,w.
    An s line defines the viewport in the normalized coordinates
    No clipping is required for this lab.

  

    For simplicity this lab assumes a parallel projection with direction of projection
       being parallel to the z axis with no clipping in  the 3-  dimensional world (these
       features will be added in the future labs). 

    It is assumed that all data are given in right-handed  coordinate  system. The positive
       direction of rotation is counter clock-wise when viewed from plus infinity.

    Your program should display the data by simply dropping (ignoring) the z coordinates of
       each vertex (map your data to 2- dimensional world coordinate system), and then map
       data from 2D window to viewport. You do not need to implement  clipping for this lab.

    Your program should draw the boundaries of the viewport.

    Sample data files:

    Pyramid
    Cow
    Teapot
