                                           DUE DATE: Apr. 04, 2016

Purpose:
    Practice in three-dimensional transforms.

    Practice in three-dimensional clipping.

    Parallel projection mapping.

This assignment extends assignments 01 and 02  to include 3d clipping and parallel projections.Write a graphic package to include the following commands.

  * Browse

    This command should allow the user to select an input file . 

  * Load (Open) Input File

    This command loads all the data and parameters from the input text file and displays the objects using parallel projection.

     All objects should be clipped in 3-d and displayed in the viewport. Each line of the file will contain either a vertex, a

     face, or a  viewing parameter definition as described below:


    Old:

     - Rotate around x axis by D degrees in N incremental steps (Same as previous assignment)

       This command rotates all the objects around line x axis by D degrees in N incremental steps.

       The intermediate results  should be displayed

     - Rotate around y axis by D degrees in N incremental steps (Same as previous assignment)

       This command rotates all the objects around line y axis by D degrees in N incremental steps.

       The intermediate results  should be displayed

     - Rotate around z axis  by D degrees in N incremental steps (Same as previous assignment)

       This command rotates all the objects around line z axis by D degrees in N incremental steps.

       The intermediate results  should be  displayed

     - Scale Sx, Sy, Sz around point Ax,Ay,Az in N incremental steps (Same as previous assignment)

       This command scales all the objects around point A(x,y,z)  by Sx, Sy, and Sz in N incremental steps.

       The intermediate results should be displayed


    New:

     - Translate Tx, Ty, Tz, N

       This command translates all the objects by Tx, Ty, and Tz in N incremental steps. The intermediate

       results should be displayed

     - Fly XA, YA, ZA, XB, YB, ZB, N

       This command moves VRP from Point A to point B in N incremental steps. VPN and VUP should stay the same.

       The intermediate results should be displayed


Detail format of the input file:

Each line of the file will contain either a vertex, a face, or a viewing parameter definition as described below:

v <x1> <y1> <z1>  //Define a vertex

v <x2> <y2> <z2>

.

.

.

v <xn> <yn> <zn>

f <u1> <v1> <w1> //Define a face (u,v, and w are integers corresponding to the vertex number))

f <u2> <v2> <w2>

.

.

.

f <um> <vm> <wm>

r <x> <y> <z>   //Define VRP (WC)

n <x> <y> <z>  //Define VPN (WC)

u <x> <y> <z>  //Define VUP (WC)

p <x> <y> <z>  //Define PRP (VRC)

w <umin><umax><vmin><vnax><nmin><nmax>    //Define View Volume (VRC)

s <xmin><ymin><xmax><ymax.    //Define viewport (normalized coordinates)
     
Notes:
        Each "v" line defines a new vertex with the given x,y,z coordinates.

        Each vertex is given a unique identifier starting from 1 (not 0).

        Each "f" line defines a new triangular face whose corners are the vertices with the given identifiers u,v,w.

        An s line defines the viewport in the normalized coordinates

        The set of the r, n, u, p, w, and s define the viewing parameters and viewport for the parallel projection.

        Your program must include 3-dimensional clipping.

        Boundaries of the viewports must be displayed.

        The user should be able to resize the canvas and the content of the canvas should be automatically refreshed proportionally.

 
Sample input files:
        Pyramid

        Cow

        Bunny

        Teapot

        Teapot lid
